# machine-learning-
# This Machine Learning project was done during a course I completed in October
# The project touched on these supervised learning techniques: Decision Tree, Random Forrest, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM and Logistic Regression
#The dataset used was a public base from UCI repository named "mammographic massess"
# The objective was to see which supervised learning method yielded the highest accuracy
